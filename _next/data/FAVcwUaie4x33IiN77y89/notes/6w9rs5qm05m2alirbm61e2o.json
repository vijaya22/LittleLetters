I wish we met and had fun like this every now and then. </p>\n<p>We went to paintball which was so fun. Then we went to Thalassa which was also amazing and on the way down, it was Mayday, ie. the leads went down. ;)\nWe also went to North goa - Baga beach , went to the beach clicked some great pictures and had some drinks.
