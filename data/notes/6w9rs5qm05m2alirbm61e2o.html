<p>The workation in Goa was great. We had so much fun. I met a lot of new people, made new friends and obviuosly the extension peeps.</p>
<p>The extension gang and the beach drinks, late night games by the pool were all so amazing. I wish we met and had fun like this every now and then. </p>
<p>We went to paintball which was so fun. Then we went to Thalassa which was also amazing and on the way down, it was Mayday, ie. the leads went down. ;)
We also went to North goa - Baga beach , went to the beach clicked some great pictures and had some drinks. We also had fish pedicures. It was so fun. I was so scared at first but you know everyone was. It really was the highlight.</p>
<p>It was really an amazing trip.</p>
