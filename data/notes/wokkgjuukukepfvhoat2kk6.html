<p>Running is as we know is the best cardio. And also I ran 200 kms in the year 2022.
So now I plan to run to 1100 kms in the year 2023, approximately 100kms per month. This will definitely bring my resting heart rate down and increase my fitness level.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot of my 2022 run summary. ;)</p>
