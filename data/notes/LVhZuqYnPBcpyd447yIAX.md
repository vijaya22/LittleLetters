There were a lot of good things that happened this week. One of them would I cooked chicken for the first time in my life (chicken 65). Also I talked to my friends Stuthi, Sachin sir & Jawa sir after long time, so I guess it was fun. One more, my sister got called for an interview - will reveal later.
