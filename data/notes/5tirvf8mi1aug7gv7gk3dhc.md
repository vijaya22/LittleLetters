So its basically June 2nd, 2022. And [my boyfriend](https://twitter.com/iliekcomputers) has gone back to Dublin. So officially, we are in a LDR (long distance relationship). I won't say its bad. But obviously, I miss him being around. ;)

But enough of that. What we are doing now adays is have our date nights or if I say my boyfriend's date lunch. So we sit together once a week to eat and talk and also play some games. Its actually quite fun.
