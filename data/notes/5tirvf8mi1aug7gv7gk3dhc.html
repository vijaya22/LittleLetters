<h1 id="long-distance-date-night">Long Distance Date Night<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#long-distance-date-night"></a></h1>
<p>So its basically June 2nd, 2022. And <a href="https://twitter.com/iliekcomputers">my boyfriend</a> has gone back to Dublin. So officially, we are in a LDR (long distance relationship). I won't say its bad. But obviously, I miss him being around. ;)</p>
<p>But enough of that. What we are doing now adays is have our date nights or if I say my boyfriend's date lunch. So we sit together once a week to eat and talk and also play some games. Its actually quite fun.</p>
