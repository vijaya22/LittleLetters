<p>What is Redux ?</p>
<p>Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". </p>
<p>It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.</p>
<p>Redux is normally used by installing the Redux packages from NPM, and the UI is created using a library like React.</p>
<p>When should I use Redux?</p>
<p>Redux is more useful when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app</li>
<li>The app state is updated frequently over time</li>
<li>The logic to update that state may be complex</li>
<li>The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people</li>
</ul>
<p>Redux Libraries and Tools</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>React-Redux
React-Redux is the official package that lets React components interact with a Redux store by reading pieces of state and dispatching actions to update the store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redux Toolkit
Used for writing Redux Logic. It contains packages and functions that are essential for building a Redux app.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redux DevTools Extension
This allows to debug applications effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Redux Store</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The center of every Redux application is the store. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A "store" is a container that holds your application's global state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A store is a JavaScript object with a few special functions and abilities that make it different than a plain global object</p>
