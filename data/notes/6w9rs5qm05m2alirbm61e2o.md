# Goa Workation

The workation in Goa was great. We had so much fun. I met a lot of new people, made new friends and obviuosly the extension peeps.

The extension gang and the beach drinks, late night games by the pool were all so amazing. I wish we met and had fun like this every now and then. 

We went to paintball which was so fun. Then we went to Thalassa which was also amazing and on the way down, it was Mayday, ie. the leads went down. ;)
We also went to North goa - Baga beach , went to the beach clicked some great pictures and had some drinks. We also had fish pedicures. It was so fun. I was so scared at first but you know everyone was. It really was the highlight.

It was really an amazing trip.
