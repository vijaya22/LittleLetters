Okay, so the best day was the last day at MIND. I even got a small internal farewell by Aditya sir, Hitesh sir & Gurbaaz. Ashna and Anshu even put stories for me. Sonia mam, Stuthi, Ashna, Manisha, Param, Kartikeya made it really special. Also my sister made cake for me and my parents celebrated my farewell.
