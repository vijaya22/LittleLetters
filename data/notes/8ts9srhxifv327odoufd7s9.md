This week has been a dreamy sequence. A lot of things happened this week, but I'm still choosing this as my favourite one.

So I and [my boyfriend](https://twitter.com/iliekcomputers) went on our first official date night on 17th March. After this I can say, date nights are the best.

Also I'm attaching one of favourite things from this week.
