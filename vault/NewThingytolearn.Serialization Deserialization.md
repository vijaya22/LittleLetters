Serialization

Serialization converts an in-memory data structure to a value that can be stored or transferred. For example, In Javascript, we can serialize the usersObject by passing it into the JSON.stringify() function.

Deserialization

The conversion from serialized string to an in-memory data structure is deserialization. We can accomplish this with the JavaScript JSON.parse() function.
